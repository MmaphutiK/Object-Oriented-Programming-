# Object-Oriented-Programming-
his Python program uses object-oriented programming (OOP) to build a small superhero system. It starts with a main class called Superhero, which acts as a blueprint for all heroes. This class has three attributes: name (the superhero’s name), origin (where they come from), and power_level (a number that represents how strong they are). The name is written as _name, using a single underscore to follow the concept of encapsulation, meaning it’s meant to be used carefully and not changed directly from outside the class. The Superhero class has two methods: get_identity(), which tells us the hero's name and origin, and use_power(), which is a generic message saying the hero uses their power. From this base, two new types of heroes are created using inheritance. The FlyingHero class inherits everything from Superhero but adds a new attribute called flight_speed, and it overrides the use_power() method to describe flying at a specific speed. The TechHero class also inherits from Superhero but includes a list of gadgets and overrides the use_power() method to mention those gadgets. This overriding of the same method in different ways demonstrates polymorphism, where the same function behaves differently based on the type of object calling it. Finally, two heroes are created—SkyBlade, a flying hero, and Circuit, a tech hero—and their identity and powers are displayed. Overall, the code demonstrates the core principles of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, while making the idea of superheroes fun and easy to understand through simple examples.
